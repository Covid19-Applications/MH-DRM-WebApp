                       Responding First as a Leading Power
                     </div>   
                     <div class="card-body">

                      The emerging concept of India as a “first responder” reflects the country’s growing capability and
increasing willingness to assume the role of a leading power. By contributing its resources to prevent
or mitigate regional and international crises, India is demonstrating its commitment as a responsible
actor in the international order. Beyond narrow self-interest, such contributions help project India’s
soft power abroad and portray India in a positive light. They also reflect India’s expanding sphere of
influence and capacity to shape events abroad.<br><br>
The international order is facing a variety of transnational challenges that occasionally erupt into
acute crises. Whether it is a natural catastrophe, an Internet disruption, or a sudden financial shock,
the repercussions are often massive, with regional and global implications. This is where individual
states must take immediate action, to mitigate the crisis impact and avoid further escalation. By
taking the lead, they are providing a public good to the international order, supporting smaller or
less capable states in dire need of assistance.<br><br>
As the Indian economy surges on and the country emerges as one of the key actors in the
international order, expectations are consequently growing about India’s capacity to provide such
support as a first responder to crises beyond its borders. Commenting on this rising role, Foreign
Secretary Dr. S. Jaishankar thus emphasizes that India’s foreign policy dimension is “to aspire to be
a leading power, rather than just a balancing power ... (and) a willingness to shoulder greater global
responsibilities.”<br><br>
While the concept of “first responder” has generally been interpreted quite narrowly, focusing on
humanitarian disasters, a broader definition illustrates how India has played a crucial role in
assuming these “global responsibilities” by responding to a variety of crises in its neighbourhood
and beyond. This is particularly apparent in seven issue-areas.<br><br>

                     <div class="card-body">
When the forces of nature unleash their fury on South Asia, the Indian government and military
forces have played a critical role in supporting neighbouring countries in relief operations. After the
2004 tsunami, India deployed 14 Navy vessels, nearly 1,000 military personnel and several dozen
helicopters and airplanes to Sri Lanka. In 2007, in the aftermath of cyclone Sidr, India was one of
the few countries allowed to provide relief to Myanmar and provided critical rice supplies to address
food emergencies there. In 2015, less than six hours after Nepal was rattled by a tragic earthquake
taking almost 9,000 lives, the Indian Air Force flew in National Disaster Response Force (NDRF)
rescue team. Over the next days, India lead on the ground, landing 32 flights with 520 tonnes of
relief and more than fifty medical, Army engineering and other rescue operation teams. In 2014, the
Indian Navy was the first to arrive in the Madives to provide fresh drinking water to more than
150,000 of its citizens facing an acute supply crisis. More recently, in response to Cyclone More
(2017), India was the first to respond to the devastating floods in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. As
reflected in relief provided to Pakistan in 2005 and 2010, Indian support transcends political
considerations and is driven by a deep humanitarian drive.

When crises erupt abroad, India is often the first on the ground to protect the lives and assets of its
nationals. By mobilizing its consular officers, New Delhi has also provided safe evacuation to
citizens from other countries. In 2015, for example, India extricated almost 2,000 nationals from 48
different countries, including many from the European Union, the United States and neighbouring
countries. The Ministry of External Affairs, Air India, and the Navy and Air Force have emerged as
key actors in conflict zones, especially in the Indian Ocean and Gulf region, normally operating as
first responders coming to the rescue of thousands of foreign nationals in distress.

The Indian Navy has emerged as the Indian Ocean’s default first responder to non-traditional
security challenges. To combat piracy in the Gulf of Aden since 2008, it deployed almost thirty
warships that have escorted more than 1500 ships and thwarted around thirty piracy attempts. India
was a founder-member of the Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia (CGPCS) and has
taken a lead role in coordination efforts among different naval forces in the region. When airplanes
or ships go missing in its extended neighbourhood, India has often been among the first responders
to participate in search and rescue missions. In 2014, the Indian Coast Guard deployed around the
Andaman and Nicobar Islands in initial efforts to locate the missing Malaysian Airlines flight
MH370.
